The aim of this project was to develop a virtual ‘Save Our Planet’ board game. This required a process of analysing the project’s requirements, considering the system’s design and to implement and test a reliable working version of the game, with the appropriate functionality.

# Design

The game design process involved common OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles and practices, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. 

# Development

An Agile Development process was followed, which allowed for a collaborative approach among the team with a focus on producing functional, working code and building on that to meet the required objectives.
